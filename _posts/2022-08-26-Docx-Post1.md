Graph Description Notes:

  - > Context - Use variable/group names

  - > Shape (Roughly symmetric, double peaked binomial, single peaked unimodal, right or left skew)

  - > Outliers - Any unusual observations

  - > Center - The average/typical values

  - > Spread - Variability

  - > If comparing, use comparative language for center/spread (higher, lower, etc.)

Center:

  - > Median - the middle point if a distribution

  - > Use with skewed data

Mean:

  - > m = sum of terms/number of terms

<!-- end list -->

  - > Use with symmetric data

Variability:

  - > Range = Maximum - Minimum

  - > ‘The context typically varies by sx from the mean of x.’

Non-Resistant Measures:

  - > Greatly affected by extreme values

  - > Example: Mean, standard deviation, range
