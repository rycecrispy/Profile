    "- Simulations can contain bias\n",
    "- They can be used to simulate things as tests (ie, launching a bomb) when these actions are too dangerous/impractical to do in the real world \n",
    "- Simulations can also be used to create situations that are too difficult to recreate in the real world (specific weather conditions for example)\n",
    "- Random modules define series of objects that can be generated randomly\n",
    "- Randomization helps simulations, as they can help predict many varying probablilities of a simulation\n",
    "- Abstractions use conditionals to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met, repeat looping, simplification, and it does not request input from the user or display output to the user\n",
    "- It is far cheaper to create a simulation than to do said actions in real life\n",
